            <h1>Privacy Policy for ACC Race Control</h1>
            <p>Leonard Schüngel built the ACC Race Control application as an Open Source app. This application is
                provided
                by
                Leonard Schüngel at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
            <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of
                Personal
                Information if anyone decided to use the application.</p>
            <p>If you choose to use the application, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation
                to
                this
                policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will
                not
                use
                or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are
                accessible
                at ACC Race Control unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
            <p>The application will not collect personally identifiable information except for those mentioned in the
                sections
                bellow.</p>
            <p>The application will connect to and use data provided by the game Assetto Corsa Competizione for the
                duration
                the
                application is running. The Data collected from the game is subject to the privacy policy of the game.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
            <p>I want to inform you that whenever you use the application, in a case of an error in the application I
                collect
                data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
                include
                information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version,
                the
                configuration of the application, the time and date of your use of the application, and other
                statistics.
                The
                information that is collected will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.</p>
            <p><strong>Information collection, usage and storage when using the Google Sheet integration</strong></p>
            <p>When using the Google Sheets integration in ACC Race Control, the application will communicate with
                Google
                Services to provide the intended user experience. All communication with Google services is done
                directly
                from
                the application to Google services.</p>
            <p>The user may connect the application to a Google Sheets Spreadsheet using the Google sheets integration
                of
                ACC
                Race Control. The application will then write data (collision information, race entry lists) to the
                spreadsheet.
                The application will read data from the spreadsheet to find empty fields it can write data to or to
                synchronize
                the entry list with the entry list stored in the application.</p>
            <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
            <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
                These
                are
                sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device&#39;s internal
                memory.
            </p>
            <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and
                libraries
                that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either
                accept
                or
                refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our
                cookies,
                you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.</p>
            <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
            <p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                acceptable
                means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of
                electronic
                storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
            <p>I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. I encourage all children to
                never
                submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. I encourage
                parents
                and
                legal guardians to monitor their children&#39;s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by
                instructing
                their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or
                Services
                without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally
                identifiable
                information to us through the Application and/or Services, please contact us. You must also be at least
                16
                years
                of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some
                countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).</p>
            <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
            <p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically
                for
                any
                changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
            <p>This policy is effective as of 2022-03-15</p>
